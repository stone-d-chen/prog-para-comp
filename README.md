## Todos (potentially)

### Median Filter

-   Hand rolled, median of medians
-   recursive -\> iterative
-   refactor quicksort into a separate partition function

## Updates

2023/23/6

-   Median Filter sequential, had some issues getting QuickSelect working, should do a more in-depth write up
-   Turns out I could just use nth_element which is way faster
